# mice\_new

Not so complex as the previous version. OOP is soooo nice.

usage:
first create a index file, it should store the path, type(mutant or wild), batch name, start point(number of day), end point(num of day). 
You can make this through bash script easily. 
Then ./run [path to index file]
This will also output the outcome into a plantext file "table", it has the format like csv.

After the analysis, you will need to run ./doc [path to index file]. This will generate a report.pdf
